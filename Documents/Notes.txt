From Morris (2008)

When variances were heterogeneous, sampling variance formulas for both dppc1 and dppc2 underesti- mated the true sampling variance. Because the estimated variances are too small, tests for homogeneity of effect size will be inflated. Consequently, a meta-analyst might incorrectly conclude that effect sizes are heterogeneous and potentially search for moderators of the effect size where none exist. 





## Multiple-treatment study: 

Ke (2008) compared multiple experimental conditions (cooperative, competitive and individualistic) with a common control group.

## Multiple-endpoint studies: 

Pareto et al. (2011), Riconscente (2013) and Starkey (2013), investigated two different motivational constructs in common subjects, therefore, the effects for these measures were correlated. 

Four studies (Mavridis, Katmada, & Tsiatsos, 2017; McCue, 2011; Rodríguez-Aflecht et al., 2015; Starkey, 2013) used multidimensional instruments that reflect different aspects of motivational construct. We considered all the dimensions effect sizes, but we accounted for dependence among them.

Concerning other publications, in a study (Ke, 2006) three different treatment conditions were compared with three different comparable control groups; therefore, we analyzed them separately, as independent effect sizes. 

One study (Chang et al., 2016) reported data from girls and boys separately, but in the analysis we included the combined results; moreover, the authors examined three different sub-domains of engagement (behavioral, emotional, cognitive), but we considered only the emotional engagement related in literature to student interest and values (Eccles et al., 1983; Fredricks et al., 2004). 

Hung et al. (2014) reported two measures of motivation, but the results of the learning motivation pre-test appeared ambiguous, therefore we considered only data of the self-efficacy questionnaire. 

Since Riconscente’s (2013) study used a repeated measures crossover design, we considered data to the first half of the study, before the two groups switch. 

Finally, McCue (2011) examined effects associated with designing and constructing video-games on student attitudes toward mathematics.



# Important to underline il the conclusions that 12 out of 37 eligible studies (32%) could not be included as they did not report all relevant data (sample size, arithmetic mean and standard deviation) required to calculate the effect size. 

#### 

In 12 cases post-treatment score in the treatment group is lower than pre-treatment score... check for reverse scoring.
