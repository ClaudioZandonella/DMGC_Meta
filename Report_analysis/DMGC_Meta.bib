  abstract = {This study investigates three methods to handle dependency among effect size estimates in meta-analysis arising from studies reporting multiple outcome measures taken on the same sample. The three-level approach is compared with the method of robust variance estimation, and with averaging effects within studies. A simulation study is performed, and the fixed and random effect estimates of the three methods are compared with each other. Both the robust variance estimation and three-level approach result in unbiased estimates of the fixed effects, corresponding standard errors and variances. Averaging effect sizes results in overestimated standard errors when the effect sizes within studies are truly independent. Although the robust variance and three-level approach are more complicated to use, they have the advantage that they do not require an estimate of the correlation between outcomes, and they still result in unbiased parameter estimates.},

Unfortunately, traditional meta-regression methods are ill-equipped to handle the complex and often unknown correlations among non-independent effect sizes.

The robumeta package provides functions for performing robust variance meta-regression using both large and small sample RVE estimators under various weighting schemes. These methods are distribution free and provide valid point estimates, standard errors and hypothesis tests even when the degree and structure of dependence between effect sizes is unknown.},

An example is where in one or more studies the effect of an intervention is evaluated on multiple outcome variables for the same sample of participants. In this paper, we evaluate a three-level meta-analytic model to account for this kind of dependence, extending the simulation results of Van den Noortgate, L{\'o}pez-L{\'o}pez, Mar{\'i}n-Mart{\'i}nez, and S{\'a}nchez-Meca Behavior Research Methods, 45, 576\textendash{}594 (2013) by allowing for a variation in the number of effect sizes per study, in the between-study variance, in the correlations between pairs of outcomes, and in the sample size of the studies. At the same time, we explore the performance of the approach if the outcomes used in a study can be regarded as a random sample from a population of outcomes. We conclude that although this approach is relatively simple and does not require prior estimates of the sampling covariances between effect sizes, it gives appropriate mean effect size estimates, standard error estimates, and confidence interval coverage proportions in a variety of realistic situations.},

Fourth through sixth grade classrooms were randomly assigned into either an experimental group (students n=642) which played NNG during a 10-week period or into a control group (students n=526) which continued with a traditional textbook-based mathematics curriculum. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of the intervention on students' motivation and to explore how students' differing game experiences were related to changes in their motivation and, as an indicator of cognitive outcomes, their arithmetic fluency. Results indicate the intervention resulted in small decreases in the math motivation expectancy-values of interest, utility, and attainment value. Students had mixed game experiences which varied by gender and grade level. When looking at the role of these game experiences on post-test motivation and arithmetic fluency, corresponding pre-test values were the strongest predictive variables. Out of game experiences, only competence was a significant predictor of post-test motivational scores; however, no game experience variable was a predictor of post-test arithmetic fluency.},

A pre-post design was employed, with 634 primary (elementary) school children (10\textendash{}11 years old) from 32 schools across Scotland. Schools were randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. In the experimental schools, children used a games console for 20 minutes each day, running a `brain training' game. The controls continued with their normal routine. The treatment period was 9 weeks. Significant pre-post gains in accuracy and speed of calculations were found in both experimental and control groups over the treatment period. Gains in the experimental group were 50\% greater than those of the controls in accuracy, and twice those of the controls in speed. There were no significant changes in two measures of self-concept for either group. There was a small but statistically significant improvement in attitude towards school among the experimental group but not the controls. When scores were analysed by ability, different patterns were apparent. The design of the study allows a degree of confidence when generalising from these results.

In this pre- and post-test experimental comparison study, data were collected from 132 fourth-graders through a Short Instructional Materials Motivation Survey. The same tasks were provided for the experimental and control groups, except that the control group's tasks did not include the four aforementioned gaming characteristics. The non-GBL for the control group involved mainly web-based word problems such as selecting the correct answer by clicking on the potential responses. P-MQLA was improved after the intervention in both groups. There is a trend that the experimental group improved the P-MQLA more than the control group, at borderline statistical significance. The analysis of covariance also indicated a significant interaction between the group variable and the pre-intervention P-MQLA, indicating that the effect of the virtual reality-supported GBL is moderated by learners' preintervention report of P-MQLA.},

Students were assessed using standardised tests at the beginning and completion of the term and findings indicated that students who undertook the Brain Training pilot study using the HGCs showed significant improvement in both the speed and accuracy of their mathematical calculations and selfconcept compared to students in the control school. An exploration of the intervention, discussion of methodology and the implications of the use of HGCs in the primary classroom are presented.},

  abstract = {Although fractions knowledge is essential for future success in mathematics, data show that most U.S. students fail to become proficient in fractions. With the advent of mobile technologies such as iPad tablets, new kinds of interactions with subject matter have become possible that have potential for improving learning. The present study used an experimental repeated measures crossover design to investigate whether the iPad fractions game Motion Math would improve fourth graders' fractions knowledge and attitudes. In results from 122 participants, students' fractions test scores improved an average of over 15\% after playing Motion Math for 20 min daily over a 5-day period, representing a significant increase compared to a control group. In addition, children's self-efficacy for fractions, as well as their liking of fractions, each improved an average of 10\%, representing a statistically significant increase compared to a control group. Implications for the design and study of interactive games are discussed.},

  abstract = {It is known that computer games are motivating for children, but there is limited direct evidence of their effects on classroom learning. The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the effects of a commercial off-the-shelf computer game on children's mental computation skills and on aspects of self-perceptions. A pre\textendash{}post design was employed. The participants were 71 primary school children (10\textendash{}11 years old) from three classes. In School 1, a class of 21 children used a games console for 20 minutes each day, running a `brain training' game. Two comparison groups were used. In School 2, 31 children used `Brain Gym' techniques in their class over the treatment period. In school three, a class of 19 children acted as no-treatment controls. The treatment period was 10 weeks. Significant pre\textendash{}post gains were found in the games console group for both accuracy and speed of calculations, while results for the two comparison groups were mixed. The games console group showed significant gains in global self-esteem, but not in other aspects of self-concept. The comparison groups showed no significant gains in any area of selfperceptions. There is a need now for upscaling to investigate generalisability.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis of psychotherapy intervention research normally examines differences between treatment groups and some form of comparison group (e.g., wait list control; alternative treatment group). The effect of treatment is normally quantified as a standardized mean difference (SMD). We describe procedures for computing unbiased estimates of the population SMD from sample data (e.g., group Ms and SDs), and provide guidance about a number of complications that may arise related to effect size computation. These complications include (a) incomplete data in research reports; (b) use of baseline data in computing SMDs and estimating the population standard deviation ({$\sigma$}); (c) combining effect size data from studies using different research designs; and (d) appropriate techniques for analysis of data from studies providing multiple estimates of the effect of interest (i.e., dependent effect sizes).},
