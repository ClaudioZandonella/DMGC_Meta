  abstract = {This research study assessed the effectiveness of a three-dimensional mathematics game, DimensionM, through a pretest\textendash{}posttest control group quasi-experimental design. Participants consisted of 437 eighth graders. The classrooms were randomly assigned either to the treatment group that utilized DimensionM as a supplement to regular classroom instructions or to the control group that received regular class instructions without any computer activities. The results of the analysis on the pretest\textendash{}posttest data revealed that the DimensionM game increased mathematical knowledge acquisition in algebra and maintained student motivation to learn. The findings suggest that the implementation of DimensionM in mathematics education can greatly benefit middle school students learning algebra. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic \textbullet{} Evaluations on the effectiveness of instructional games are known in the community of both practitioners and experienced researchers in educational research. What this paper adds \textbullet{} This paper specifically added to the literature by evaluating the effectiveness of the novel instructional game, the DimensionM game, on increasing middle school student mathematical knowledge acquisition in algebra and maintaining student motivation to learn.

  abstract = {An adjusted rank correlation test is proposed as a technique for identifying publication bias in a meta-analysis, and its operating characteristics are evaluated via simulations. The test statistic is a direct statistical analogue of the popular "funnel-graph." The number of component studies in the meta-analysis, the nature of the selection mechanism, the range of variances of the effect size estimates, and the true underlying effect size are all observed to be influential in determining the power of the test. The test is fairly powerful for large meta-analyses with 75 component studies, but has only moderate power for meta-analyses with 25 component studies. However, in many of the configurations in which there is low power, there is also relatively little bias in the summary effect size estimate. Nonetheless, the test must be interpreted with caution in small meta-analyses. In particular, bias cannot be ruled out if the test is not significant. The proposed technique has potential utility as an exploratory tool for meta-analysts, as a formal procedure to complement the funnelgraph.},

  abstract = {Objective: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision.
Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias.
Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

In this pre- and post-test experimental comparison study, data were collected from 132 fourth-graders through a Short Instructional Materials Motivation Survey. The same tasks were provided for the experimental and control groups, except that the control group's tasks did not include the four aforementioned gaming characteristics. The non-GBL for the control group involved mainly web-based word problems such as selecting the correct answer by clicking on the potential responses. P-MQLA was improved after the intervention in both groups. There is a trend that the experimental group improved the P-MQLA more than the control group, at borderline statistical significance. The analysis of covariance also indicated a significant interaction between the group variable and the pre-intervention P-MQLA, indicating that the effect of the virtual reality-supported GBL is moderated by learners' preintervention report of P-MQLA.},

  abstract = {Publication bias is a serious problem in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which can affect the validity and generalization of conclusions. Currently, approaches to dealing with publication bias can be distinguished into two classes: selection models and funnel-plot-based methods. Selection models use weight functions to adjust the overall effect size estimate and are usually employed as sensitivity analyses to assess the potential impact of publication bias. Funnel-plotbased methods include visual examination of a funnel plot, regression and rank tests, and the nonparametric trim and fill method. Although these approaches have been widely used in applications, measures for quantifying publication bias are seldom studied in the literature. Such measures can be used as a characteristic of a meta-analysis; also, they permit comparisons of publication biases between different meta-analyses. Egger's regression intercept may be considered as a candidate measure, but it lacks an intuitive interpretation. This article introduces a new measure, the skewness of the standardized deviates, to quantify publication bias. This measure describes the asymmetry of the collected studies' distribution. In addition, a new test for publication bias is derived based on the skewness. Large sample properties of the new measure are studied, and its performance is illustrated using simulations and three case studies.},

  abstract = {This study examined the effects of using an online flexible educational game on students' attitude towards mathematics as compared to the traditional method of solving mathematical problems. Moreover, the study assessed the learning effectiveness of the game and investigated potential gender differences in the game's effectiveness on changing students' attitude. The participants of the study were 79 students who were randomly assigned to a control and treatment group, as well as four coordinator teachers. The game was configurable and it was used as a supplementary teaching method. The intervention lasted 14 weeks and the data collection was based on quantitative measures and interviews. The results of the analysis indicated that the game approach was effective on improving students' attitude towards mathematics and that it also resulted in better learning outcomes in the treatment group as compared to that of the control group. Furthermore, it was shown that the gender of the students did not influence the positive effect of the game on students' attitude. These results suggest that the incorporation of flexible games into the traditional teaching of mathematics could possibly bring beneficial effects.},

The studies that are available tend to be limited in terms of output data reported, or small in scale, or both. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to upscale a recent study by Miller and Robertson investigating the effects of a commercial off-the-shelf computer game on children's mental computation skills and self-perceptions. A pre-post design was employed, with 634 primary (elementary) school children (10\textendash{}11 years old) from 32 schools across Scotland. Schools were randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. In the experimental schools, children used a games console for 20 minutes each day, running a `brain training' game. The controls continued with their normal routine. The treatment period was 9 weeks. Significant pre-post gains in accuracy and speed of calculations were found in both experimental and control groups over the treatment period. Gains in the experimental group were 50\% greater than those of the controls in accuracy, and twice those of the controls in speed. There were no significant changes in two measures of self-concept for either group. There was a small but statistically significant improvement in attitude towards school among the experimental group but not the controls. When scores were analysed by ability, different patterns were apparent. The design of the study allows a degree of confidence when generalising from these results. Some implications of the findings are discussed.},

The three-level approach is compared with the method of robust variance estimation, and with averaging effects within studies. A simulation study is performed, and the fixed and random effect estimates of the three methods are compared with each other. Both the robust variance estimation and three-level approach result in unbiased estimates of the fixed effects, corresponding standard errors and variances. Averaging effect sizes results in overestimated standard errors when the effect sizes within studies are truly independent. Although the robust variance and three-level approach are more complicated to use, they have the advantage that they do not require an estimate of the correlation between outcomes, and they still result in unbiased parameter estimates.},

Fourth through sixth grade classrooms were randomly assigned into either an experimental group (students n=642) which played NNG during a 10-week period or into a control group (students n=526) which continued with a traditional textbook-based mathematics curriculum. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of the intervention on students' motivation and to explore how students' differing game experiences were related to changes in their motivation and, as an indicator of cognitive outcomes, their arithmetic fluency. Results indicate the intervention resulted in small decreases in the math motivation expectancy-values of interest, utility, and attainment value. Students had mixed game experiences which varied by gender and grade level. When looking at the role of these game experiences on post-test motivation and arithmetic fluency, corresponding pre-test values were the strongest predictive variables. Out of game experiences, only competence was a significant predictor of post-test motivational scores; however, no game experience variable was a predictor of post-test arithmetic fluency.},

An example is where in one or more studies the effect of an intervention is evaluated on multiple outcome variables for the same sample of participants.

At the same time, we explore the performance of the approach if the outcomes used in a study can be regarded as a random sample from a population of outcomes. We conclude that although this approach is relatively simple and does not require prior estimates of the sampling covariances between effect sizes, it gives appropriate mean effect size estimates, standard error estimates, and confidence interval coverage proportions in a variety of realistic situations.},
